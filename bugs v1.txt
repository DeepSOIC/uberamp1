bugs:
* all gains wrong because 8.8vpp is unachievable because fakegnd is only 3.82V
* NE5532 unusable (can't quite swing close enough to ground - need to reach 1.44 V, promised only 2 V). Using OPA1642 for now.
* r187 wrong value, should be 13k
* wrong stencil opening under lmr chips
cosmetic bugs:
* wrong silkscreen on 0805 caps
* 5v pad label placement
* indicate thin-film resistors on the schematic
