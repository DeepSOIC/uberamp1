bugs:
* 10uf cap footprint is too wide now, reflow issues
* 100n fan bypass footprint too large
* 2.2uf caps footprint too large
* resistors next to ak are too dense (shorts during reflow)
* i2c pull-ups should be smaller (adau datasheet recommends 2.2k)

todos:
* add a 1uf cap on reset line, and a pull-up (fixes startup of dsp-only version)
* add silkscreen for inductors (to help align when soldering)
* oval holes for to220

need more parts:
