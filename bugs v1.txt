bugs:
* consider using 0402 on my 0603 footprints
* feedbass is missing the discharge resistor (but can be soldered instead of the shunt cap)
* feedbass trimpot turn direction is backwards
* need protection on i2c and low voltage supplies OR use pixhawk connector
* serial pinout wrong? - esp expects rts from ftdi, but that is supposed to be wired to "cts" pin on the pixhawk connector 
* rx tx need resistors
* need 1uf cap on esp reset line, otherwise autoreset doesn't work
* really need an led or two on the esp

cosmetic bugs:
* wrong silkscreen on 0805 caps
* lmzm pin1 not marked
* add silkscreen for summation resistors (there is space)
* add ouput channel numbers silkscreen
* output pads on the other side?

other todos
* design a heatsink mount
* add another i2c connector footprint for standalone adau
* add -5V to input addon
* add some ground pads on top and bottom
* add fan control circuitry?

need more parts:
OPA1642
3.9nF NP0
3.3nF NP0
