bugs:
* 10u caps are a bit larger than the footprint
* wrong footprint ak caps
* consider using 0402 on my 0603 footprints
* revise jack footprint:
  * make pads larger for more robustness
  * alignment holes are too large
* feedbass is missing the discharge resistor (but can be soldered instead of the shunt cap)
* feedbass trimpot turn direction is backwards
* wrong stencil opening under lmr chips
* 3.3v ldo for digital side is not needed because we have an LMZM for esp32 already
* need protection on i2c and low voltage supplies OR use pixhawk connector

cosmetic bugs:
* wrong silkscreen on 0805 caps
* lmzm pin1 not marked
* 5v pad label placement
* add silkscreen for summation resistors (there is space)
* add ouput channel numbers silkscreen

other todos
* design a heatsink mount
* add another i2c connector footprint for standalone adau
* add -5V to input addon

need more parts:
