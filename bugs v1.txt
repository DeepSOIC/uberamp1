bugs:
* all gains wrong because 8.8vpp is unachievable because fakegnd is only 3.82V
* NE5532 unusable (can't quite swing close enough to ground - need to reach 1.44 V, promised only 2 V). Using OPA1642 for now.
* with modified gains, the overall gain seems to be excessive. (check again!)
* r187 wrong value, should be 13k
* ak4454 NEEDS pg signal, otherwise it fails to start when supply raises slowly
* middle cap next to adau is very hard to solder
* caps to the left of dac amp are difficult to solder
* 10u caps are a bit larger than the footprint
* wrong footprint ak caps
* consider using 0402 on my 0603 footprints
* revise jack footprint:
  * make pads larger for more robustness
  * alignment holes are too large
* feedbass is missing the discharge resistor (but can be soldered instead of the shunt cap)
* wrong stencil opening under lmr chips
* 3.3v ldo for digital side is not needed because we have an LMZM for esp32 already
* 7812 gets quite hot. Replace with a capacitor amplifier?

cosmetic bugs:
* wrong silkscreen on 0805 caps
* lmzm pin1 not marked
* 5v pad label placement
* indicate thin-film resistors on the schematic 
* add silkscreen for summation resistors (there is space)
* add ouput channel numbers silkscreen
* fix fb0 fb1 confusion
